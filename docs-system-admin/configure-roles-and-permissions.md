# Configure roles and permissions

Pseudonymisation Portal uses a role-based access control system to manage user permissions and access to different features within the application. Your organisation defines roles and their associated permissions through the application configuration file.

In this guide

> [Understand the role configuration](#understand-the-role-configuration)  
> [Map roles and permissions](#map-roles-and-permissions)  
> [Available permissions reference](#available-permissions)

## Understand the role configuration

When deploying Pseudonymisation Portal, you will work with two types of roles:

- **Identity management roles**: Roles managed by your external OpenID Connect **(OIDC)** provider and Access Management **(IAM)** system. These roles are included in JWT tokens during [authentication](set-up-authentication.md).
- **Organisational roles**: Roles defined within the Pseudonymisation Portal application configuration that determine what actions users can perform within datasets. To understand the default roles pre-defined in the application, see [user roles and permissions](/user-guide/roles-and-permissions).

## Map roles and permissions

Configure your organisational roles in your `config.json` file to match your organisation's access control requirements.

1. **Edit the configuration file:** Open the `config.json` file as described in [configure the application](configure-the-application.md).

2. **Define your organisational roles:** Locate the default organisational roles in the `roles` section and rename them to correspond with your organisation's OIDC/IAM roles.

   :::tip Defining roles

   - **To understand the default organisational roles**, their hierarchy, and relationships, see [user roles and permissions](/user-guide/roles-and-permissions).
   - **When defining your own roles**, align them with your organisation's structure and workflow. Consider your approval process for the different stages of the dataset lifecycle, and the different levels of access (individual, group, and organisation-wide).

   :::

   Here's an example configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "config_version": "1.0",
     "roles_path_in_access_token": "<resource_access.{client_id}.roles>", // replace with the path to the list of role identifiers inside the
     "roles": [
       {
         "name": "<ROLE_NAME>",
         "permissions": [
           "datasets:edit:draft:my",
           "datasets:status-change:complete:my"
         ]
       }
       // Add more roles as needed
     ]
   }
   ```

   Replace `<resource_access.{client_id}.roles>` with the path to the list of role identifiers inside the [access token](set-up-authentication.md).

3. **Assign minimum permissions:** For every role you define, ensure it includes at least one of the following minimum permissions:

   - `datasets:read`
   - `datasets:edit:draft:my`
   - `datasets:edit:draft:organisation`
   - `datasets:edit:draft:group`
   - `form-fields:edit`
   - `form-fields:edit:my`
   - `form-fields:edit:organisation`

   For a description of these permissions, see [available permissions](#available-permissions).

   :::info Minimum access requirements

   You must assign every user **at least one role with one of the minimum permissions** described in this step. Users without these minimum permissions will receive a "**403 Forbidden**" error when accessing the application.

   :::

4. **Configure the role mapping path:** Specify where roles appear in JWT tokens. Here's an example configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "roles_path_in_access_token": "resource_access.{client_id}.roles"
   }
   ```

## Available permissions

The following tables list all available permissions in Pseudonymisation Portal. Refer to this section when assigning permissions to your organisational roles.
