# Portal overview

The Pseudonymisation Portal is organised into main sections that help you manage organisations, projects, and pseudonymisation requests.

## Main sections

### Organisations

View and manage organisations:
- See your organisation details
- Access organisation keys for collaboration
- View organisation members (admins only)

Use this section to find your organisation key when setting up collaboration with partners.

### Projects

Work with pseudonymisation projects:
- Create new projects
- Add collaborating organisations
- Configure retention periods and treatment settings
- View project details and status

Projects are where you define the terms of your data sharing collaboration.

### Requests

Manage pseudonymisation requests:
- Submit new pseudonymisation requests
- Track request status
- View approval history
- Access approved requests for token generation

After a request is approved, you can generate tokens from this section.
