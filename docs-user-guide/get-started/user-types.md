# User types

The portal supports two user types, each with different capabilities and permissions.

## Administrator

Administrators have full access to manage the portal and oversee all activities.

**What administrators can do:**

- Create unlimited organisations
- Update organisation details (deletion is not currently supported)
- Approve or reject requests from users to create organisations
- Assign users to different organisations
- Approve or reject pseudonymisation requests
- Receive notifications when users submit requests

Use administrator access when you need to manage multiple organisations or oversee data sharing approvals.

## Normal user

Normal users work with data within their assigned organisation.

**What normal users can do:**

- Create **one organisation** (requires admin approval)
- Join organisations when assigned by an administrator
- Can only belong to one organisation at a time
- Create projects within their organisation
- Create pseudonymisation requests
- Generate tokens after request approval
- Can operate as a free user (not associated with any organisation)

:::info
Once your organisation request is approved, you cannot create additional organisations unless an administrator reassigns you. Users can only view and work with the organisation they created or are assigned to.
