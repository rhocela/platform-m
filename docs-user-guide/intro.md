# Welcome to the Pseudonymisation Portal

Welcome to the Pseudonymisation Portal user guide!

The Pseudonymisation Portal helps you protect personally identifiable information (PII) when sharing sensitive data with partners and collaborators. Generate pseudonymisation tokens, control data access, and manage collaboration—all while maintaining privacy and compliance.

Use the portal to set up projects, define collaboration terms, and generate tokens that your technical teams integrate into your data workflows. Whether you're a hospital sharing patient data with researchers or an organisation collaborating on sensitive datasets, the portal gives you the tools to share data securely.

This guide is for administrators who manage organisations and approve requests, and for users who create projects and generate tokens. You'll learn how to set up your workspace, collaborate with partners, and generate the tokens you need for secure data sharing.
